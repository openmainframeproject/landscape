            description: >-
              The Common REST API (CRA) enables you to retrieve data collected by BMC mainframe monitoring products. Currently, the API works with BMC AMI Ops
              products.


              The BMC Common REST API provides open APIs to retrieve data where those APIs can be used also through the Zowe interface and a user-friendly
              interface to experiment with the REST API calls, known as the Swagger UI.

            description: >-
              Extends Zowe CLI and Zowe Explorer APIs to let you interact with z/OS resources. The RSE plug-in

              interacts with z/OS by using IBM Remote System Explorer API (RSE API) instead of using z/OSMF. This solution is a great alternative if you have
              already used the Remote System Explorer with other IBM

              offerings such as IBM Developer for z/OS or IBM Explorer for z/OS. It is also a good option if you have not configured z/OSMF on your z/OS.
