              GenevaERS is the single-pass optimization engine for data extraction and reporting on z/OS. Originally developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers as the
              Geneva Enterprise Reporting System and acquired by IBM, GenevaERS offers businesses a high-level reporting solution uniquely tuned for big data
              scanning and improved financial transparency for better decision-making. This project combines the processing power of GenevaERS, the reliability
              of the mainframe and the dynamic open source community.
