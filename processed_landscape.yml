              Extends Zowe CLI and Zowe Explorer APIs to let you interact with z/OS resources. The RSE plug-in

              interacts with z/OS by using IBM Remote System Explorer API (RSE API) instead of using z/OSMF. This solution is a great alternative if you have
              already used the Remote System Explorer with other IBM

              offerings such as IBM Developer for z/OS or IBM Explorer for z/OS. It is also a good option if you have not configured z/OSMF on your z/OS.
