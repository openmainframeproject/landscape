                Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain. Automate everything
                from code deployment to network configuration to cloud management, in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to
                install on remote systems. https://docs.ansible.com.
